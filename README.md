# weather_today

## Getting Started

- Flutter version: 3.7.7 - Please install the appropriate version before running.
- CMD : flutter pub get -> flutter run.
- Note: The application is tested on an iOS virtual machine and has not been tested on other devices.
- Note: Because I use the free api so the application will not be able to send requests continuously.
